## Hi 👋, My name is [Dany Christel ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dany-christel-qa/)

 -  I'm shaping my path in System Administration, along with working as a Security Operations Center Analyst, using what I picked up from Quality Assurance - like how crucial dependability is, staying sharp on details, or making sure everything runs without hiccups. I like diving into servers, networks, and OS setups directly, whether fixing glitches, boosting speed, or streamlining routines so they’re safer and run better.
 -  What keeps me going is thinking ahead. Laying down solid skills in system admin now to step into a SOC Analyst job later. I’m not just aiming to keep things working smoothly, but also to shield them from threats. Each time I pick up something new or adjust to different tech, I move a bit nearer to where I want to be.
