# 👋 Hi, I'm Dany Christel — Cybersecurity & Cloud Security Junior Analyst

🔐 **Aspiring SOC Analyst | Blue Team Enthusiast | Cloud Security (AWS)**
📍 San Francisco Bay Area, CA | 🇺🇸 U.S. Citizen  
🌐 Languages: English, French, Spanish  

I am transitioning from IT Systems Support into **Cybersecurity**, focusing on building hands-on skills in:
- SOC workflows & incident response
- SIEM monitoring & alert triage
- Vulnerability management (Nessus / OpenVAS)
- Cloud security (AWS IAM, CloudTrail, least privilege)
- Windows/Linux security hardening & log analysis

My goal is to secure an entry-level role in **SOC Operations, Blue Team, or Cloud Security** where I can continue growing while contributing to security operations and defense strategies.

# Cyber Range Security Lab

## Overview
This repository documents hands-on work performed in a **Cyber Range environment** that simulates a real-world enterprise security infrastructure. The lab provides integrated security tooling and full administrative control over virtual machines, enabling practical experience in **security monitoring, threat detection, vulnerability management, and incident response**.

The goal of this project is to build job-ready skills aligned with **SOC Analyst** responsibilities using industry-standard platforms.

---

## Environment Architecture
The Cyber Range is a fully virtualized environment designed to replicate modern organizational security operations. It allows users to deploy, configure, and manage their own virtual machines while integrating enterprise security solutions for monitoring and detection.

Key capabilities include:
- Full administrator access to Windows and Linux virtual machines
- Security telemetry collection and log analysis
- Safe testing of detection, monitoring, and response workflows

---

## Security Platforms & Tools

### Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)
- Cloud-native SIEM used for centralized log collection and analysis
- Configured to ingest endpoint and system telemetry
- Used to create analytics rules and investigate security incidents
- Experience aligns with enterprise SIEM platforms such as Splunk and QRadar

### Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (EDR)
- Endpoint Detection and Response platform
- Provides endpoint visibility, alerting, and threat investigation
- Integrated with Microsoft Sentinel for incident correlation

### Tenable (Vulnerability Management)
- Enterprise vulnerability scanning and assessment tool
- Used to identify, prioritize, and analyze system vulnerabilities
- Supports remediation planning and risk-based decision making

---

## Optional & Self-Deployed Tools
The Cyber Range allows users to independently install and test additional security tools on their virtual machines, including:

- **Elastic Stack (ELK)** – Open-source log ingestion and analysis platform
- **YARA** – Malware detection and pattern-matching rules
- **Wireshark** – Network traffic analysis and packet inspection

---

## Hands-On Activities
- Deployed and administered Windows and Linux virtual machines
- Integrated endpoint telemetry into Microsoft Sentinel
- Created and tested SIEM analytics and alert rules
- Investigated security alerts and incidents using Sentinel
- Conducted vulnerability scans using Tenable
- Analyzed findings and identified remediation actions
- Reviewed endpoint security events using Defender for Endpoint

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows
- SIEM monitoring and incident investigation
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
- Vulnerability management and risk prioritization
- Log analysis and threat detection
- Windows security administration
- Cloud-based security tooling
