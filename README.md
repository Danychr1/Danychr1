## Hi ðŸ‘‹, My name is [Dany Christel ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dany-christel-qa/)
 -  Iâ€™m building my career in System Administration, drawing on my background in Quality Assurance, where I learned the importance of reliability, attention to detail, and keeping systems running smoothly. I enjoy getting hands-on experience with servers, networks, and operating systems, whether itâ€™s troubleshooting issues, improving performance, or enhancing daily operations to make them more secure and efficient.

 -  What drives me is the bigger picture: building a strong foundation in system administration today so I can grow into a SOC Analyst role tomorrow. I want to use my skills not only to keep systems up and running, but also to protect them. Every step I take in learning and adapting to new technologies brings me closer to that goal.
