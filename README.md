# 👋 Hi, I'm Dany Christel — Cybersecurity & Cloud Security Junior Analyst

🔐 **Aspiring SOC Analyst | Blue Team Enthusiast | Cloud Security (AWS)**
📍 San Francisco Bay Area, CA | 🇺🇸 U.S. Citizen  
🌐 Languages: English, French, Spanish  

I am transitioning from IT Systems Support into **Cybersecurity**, focusing on building hands-on skills in:
- SOC workflows & incident response
- SIEM monitoring & alert triage
- Vulnerability management (Nessus / OpenVAS)
- Cloud security (AWS IAM, CloudTrail, least privilege)
- Windows/Linux security hardening & log analysis

My goal is to secure an entry-level role in **SOC Operations, Blue Team, or Cloud Security** where I can continue growing while contributing to security operations and defense strategies.
