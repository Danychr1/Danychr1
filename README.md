I'm an aspiring Cloud/DevOps Engineer with a background in Quality Assurance, passionate about automation, scalability, and making software development more efficient. I love diving into hands-on projects to build real-world experience with CI/CD, cloud computing, and infrastructure as code. I'm a quick learner who enjoys solving problems and adapting to new technologies, always looking for ways to improve systems and streamline workflows. I aim to bridge the gap between development and operations, creating reliable, scalable, and high-performing solutions.
